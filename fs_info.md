- `DEFWORD <wordEng1> FROM <wordEng2> <params>`: Define a complex (non-root) word using other words. Optional parameters are:
  - `<wordEngs>`: Any number of additional words can be added as roots. These must immediately follow the `DEF FROM`.
  - `WITH-<SLICE>`: By default, all consituents are appended to each other to form the new word. A `WITH-<>` command can be used to change the concatenatino type.
    - `WITH-SLICE <ints>`: Appends all words together, but additionally removes a number of characters from the start and end of each word as specified by the `<ints>`. The order of the ints is as follows: word1start word1end word2start word2end ...

  - `GENDER <'m'|'M'|'f'|'F'|'n'|'N'|'p'|'P'>`: Adds a gendered ending to the word: `m` = Masculine, `f` = Feminine, `n` = Neutral, `p` = Plural. Use a capitalised letter to replace the last letter of the word instead of appending to it.
